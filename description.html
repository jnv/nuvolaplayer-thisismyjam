<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Incorrect album art:</b> When the profile page is visited, the album art present on the page is used regardfless of the currently playing song. TIMJ apparently does not store any reference to the art of the currently played page, so the state will have to be maintained inside the integration script.</li>
